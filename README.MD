# rM Hacks (QMLDiff version)

This repository is meant to be the continuation of the [rmHacks](https://github.com/mb1986/rm-hacks) project, this time rewritten in the [qmldiff language](https://github.com/asivery/qmldiff)

**This project is still in beta! There will be bugs!**

Most features of rm-hacks have been ported over, however, quicktools are not yet available.

## Installation

This repository only provides the source code for rm-hacks in QMD form.
It is possible to install these files using the [qt-resource-rebuilder](https://github.com/asivery/rm-xovi-extensions/tree/master/qt-resource-rebuilder) [xovi](https://github.com/asivery/xovi) extension,
but that method is only recommended if you have any other extensions in addition
to rm-hacks.
**Otherwise, please use the installer from the original rm-hacks repository linked above. (NOT YET AVAILABLE)**

### Installation using qt-resource-rebuilder

- Make sure you have `xovi` and `qt-resource-rebuilder` installed ([installation manual](https://github.com/asivery/rm-xovi-extensions/blob/master/INSTALL.MD)) and hashtab rebuilt.
- Download this repository as code (green button labelled "Code", then "Download ZIP")
- Choose the appropriate version for your device (refer to the compatibility chart below)
- Copy all the contents of the directory (`zz_rmHacks.qmd` file and `rmHacks` directory) to `/home/root/xovi/exthome/qt-resource-rebuilder` on your tablet
- Run `xovi/debug` over SSH to see if rm-hacks works correctly. If it does not, report the bug and perform the "uninstallation" steps 
- Run `xovi/start` over SSH to reboot the tablet with extensions installed

### Uninstallation

- Remove the `zz_rmHacks.qmd` and `rmHacks` directory from `/home/root/xovi/exthome/qt-resource-rebuilder` on your tablet
- Run `xovi/start` over SSH to reboot the tablet

## Updating

If the new OS version is compatible with the same version of rm-hacks you have installed (refer to compatibility chart below), it is enough to replace the `zz_rmHacks.qmd` file on the tablet. Otherwise, follow the uninstallation process, then install the new version.

## Contributing

Contributions and bugfixes are welcome, but I cannot reveal any information regarding the QMD files contained within this repository.
If you have any questions, refer to the [qmldiff language documentation](https://github.com/asivery/qmldiff).
Pull requests containing unhashed code will be automatically closed.

Every time a new version of rmHacks gets released, support for the previous version gets dropped. New features will only be added to the latest version. No feature backports will be accepted.
